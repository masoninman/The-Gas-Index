# The Gas Index
## Estimating methane leakage from U.S. cities' gas supplies

The Gas Index report and results were released on December 15, 2020, at the website https://thegasindex.org

The complete model code for replicating the results is included in this repository.

The reposistory also includes all of the model's input files, except for U.S. Census TIGER-Line files for census tract boundaries, since those files are large (> 600 MB). You can download the census tract data by state from the U.S. Census website: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2018&layergroup=Census+Tracts
