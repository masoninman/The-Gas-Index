# The Gas Index
## Estimating methane leakage from U.S. cities' gas supplies

The public launch of the Gas Index report and results will be on December 15, 2020, at the website https://thegasindex.org

If you are interested in running the model responsible for the results, the complete model code is included in this repository. The reposistory also includes all of the model's input files, except for U.S. Census TIGER-Line files for census tract boundaries, since those files are large (> 600 MB).

You can download the census tract data by state from the U.S. Census website: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2018&layergroup=Census+Tracts
