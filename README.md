# The Gas Index
Estimating methane leakage from U.S. cities' gas supplies

The public launch of the results will be on December 15, 2020, at the website https://thegasindex.org

If you are interested in running the model, the code and all input files are included in this repository, except for U.S. Census TIGER-Line files for census tract boundaries, since those files are large (> 600 MB). 

You can download the census tract data by state from the U.S. Census website: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2018&layergroup=Census+Tracts
